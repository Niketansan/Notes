The covariant return type specifies that the return type may vary in the same direction as the subclass.

Before Java5, it was not possible to override any method by changing the return type. 
But now, since Java5, it is possible to override method by changing the return type if subclass overrides any method whose return type is Non-Primitive
 but it changes its return type to subclass type.
 


Object --class predefined 

it is parent class for the all class. It has few methods we can those methods(equals, hashcode etc).


static :
